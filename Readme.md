# FG-Uschi - GetrÃ¤nkekasse
This is a fork of the neat fsikasse. Mainly it was optimised for the use case of the "Fachgruppe Umweltschutztechnik" at the University of Stuttgart. Readme will be updated soon, as there are some updates to the repo itself.

## Description

A neat little web application that manages the sale and stock of drinks and sweets. It is designed to run on a Windows 10 tablet with a resolution of 1920x1200 (Chuwi Hi8 Pro). All users are expected to be trusted and "well behaved". It was meant to have (at least) the same feature set as the paper tally sheet, which it replaced.

    $ pip install -U Flask Flask-BasicAuth Pillow Pandas Matplotlib
